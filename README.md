# FurFind

This project is a web application designed to facilitate animal adoptions. Built with React about frontend and using Express, Node.js, and MongoDB about backend, the platform allows users to post their adoption listings freely. Users can create, view, and manage their announcements, making it easier to connect animals in need of homes with potential adopters. The application aims to raise awareness about animal adoption and streamline the process for both users and shelters.
